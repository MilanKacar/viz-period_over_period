# Period over Period visualization

Sometimes one need to compare 2 periods by using PoP visualization and to have the KPIs listed so one can track the numbers and compare it witheachother. We as a niceshops team had a problem where we had to find workourunds to display the data in the way we want. So we wanted to help people out having the same problem as we by publishing our vizualization with no cost so one can analyse the data and come to the conclusions in a try to evaluate the buisness better. 

## The problems we faced:

- If we use the regular table the resulst are small and they are not giving us the feel that we are looking at the KPIs and even if we want to display it, additional calculations are applied where we have to use table calcualtion to have a look at the increase / decrease of the given values.
