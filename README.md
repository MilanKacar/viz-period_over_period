Tracking and comparing key metrics across different time periods is critical for making informed business decisions. However, traditional visualization options often fall short when it comes to clarity, flexibility, and actionable insight. The **niceshops team** encountered these challenges firsthand—so we created a **Period-over-Period Visualization** that directly addresses the limitations of default solutions. Today, we’re sharing it with the community at no cost, making it easier for any team to unlock meaningful insights and drive business growth.

## Why use this Period-over-Period visualization?

* **Clear KPI Comparison:**
  Easily track, compare, and highlight the most important business metrics for two different periods—side by side, with instant visual feedback.

* **Actionable Insights at a Glance:**
  Intuitive up/down indicators and color coding make it immediately obvious where performance is improving and where attention is needed. Users can configure which changes should be marked as positive or negative, ensuring that the visualization fits their unique business logic (for example, rising costs marked as negative).

* **No More Workarounds:**
  Eliminate the need for complicated table calculations, manual formatting, or patchwork solutions. Our visualization was purpose-built to surface trends, outliers, and deltas without additional setup.

* **Highly Customizable:**
  Easily adapt the orientation (horizontal/vertical), choose colors and labels, and highlight the KPIs that matter most to your organization.

* **Designed for Business Teams:**
  Whether you’re in e-commerce, SaaS, finance, or any other industry, period-over-period analysis is essential for understanding growth, identifying risks, and communicating results to stakeholders. This visualization helps teams move faster from data to decisions.

* **Open and Free:**
  We believe in giving back to the data community. By publishing this visualization free of charge, we hope to help other teams save time, avoid frustration, and focus on what matters: using their data to grow their business.

## Problems with Default Visualizations

### 1. Standard Tables

Traditional tables in BI tools often result in cramped displays, limited insights, and cumbersome workflows—especially when you need to highlight period-over-period changes or draw attention to KPIs.

### 2. Multiple Value Visualizations

Out-of-the-box “multiple value” visualizations typically only show a single column at a time, making it difficult to compare more than one metric or track overall changes efficiently. Adding more columns creates clutter rather than clarity.
